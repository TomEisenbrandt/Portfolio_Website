Auto Hotkey
</H1>

<P>
What is Auto Hotkey?<BR />
Auto Hotkey, AHK for short, is a scripting language commonly used to make macros.<BR/>
These macros can range from making alternate key bindings to giving faster than human input for task automation.<BR/>
In order to use the scripts I have provided here you will need the Auto Hotkey software.<BR/>
If you would like to learn more about it here are some useful links.<BR/>

<H2>Simple Escape Grapple Script</H2>
<P>
This is a VERY simple script designed to quickly break loose from<BR/>
an enemy grapple in the game 'Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen'.<BR/>

<H2>Menu Quick Access</H2>
<P>
This script is meant to be used for 'Grand Theft Auto 5: Online'<BR/>
The purpose of this script is to quickly iterate through some of the common in game menus.<BR/>
Some examples of this are the phone contacts like the mechanic, or even the CEO abilities in the interaction menu.<BR/>
The script features a very simple GUI to allow users without much coding background a chance to use.<BR/>
The script will generate a .ini file upon first use if one does not exist for it.<BR/>
SIDE NOTE 1: As this game is constantly being updated I cannot guarantee that the functionality of the script will remain intact.<BR/>
SIDE NOTE 2: AHK scripts are 100% legal to use in the game and will NOT result in a ban.<BR/>
